# Update - 2/6/2022

At this point, if there are less than 15 commits made to this project in the next 2 weeks, it probably wont
be continued. This project can still be worked further with some major code improvements, such as fixing the config bullshittery. This project was meant to be a website following the incredibly stale and overused Sandbox Model, a website consisting of a forum, a shop, a shitty 3d renderer, and a game client & game workshop. I've been working towards making websites in this category for the last 2 years and I've only recently realized how stale the genre is, with this realization being boosted by, the like, 7th(?) shutdown of BrickPlanet. I aim to make my future projects less.. shitty(?) and more original. Anyway, Isaac Hymer Deez Nuts.

## How To Setup

This project is not finished and should not be run on a webserver. To install locally, choose your preferred Web Stack (LAMP, XAMPP, etc.) and clone into the folder where your server files are stored. Execute all SQL commands on your database workbench or command line interface.

This project was inspired by FoxxoSnoot's [laravel-roblox-clone](https://github.com/FoxxoSnoot/laravel-roblox-clone).
